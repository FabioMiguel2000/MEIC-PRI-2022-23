Listen to any of the canonical Bristol-scene albums of the mid-late \u201990s, when the genre was starting to chafe against its boundaries, and you\u2019d think the claustrophobic, anxious 21st century started a few years ahead of schedule. Looked at from the right angle, trip-hop\u00a0is part of an unbroken chain that runs from the abrasion of \u201980s post-punk to the ruminative pop-R&B-dance fusion of the moment.\u00a0The best of it has aged far more gracefully (and forcefully) than anything recorded in the waning days of the record industry\u2019s pre-filesharing monomania has any right to. Tricky rebelled against being attached at the hip to a scene he was already looking to shed and decamped for Jamaica to record a more aggressive, bristling-energy mutation of his style in \u201996; the name\u00a0Pre-Millennium Tension is the only obvious thing that tells you it\u2019s two decades old rather than two weeks. And Portishead\u2019s \u201997 self-titled saw the stress-fractured voice of Beth Gibbons envisioning romance as codependent, mutually assured destruction while Geoff Barrow sunk into his RZA-noir beats like The Conversation\u2019s Gene Hackman ruminating over his surveillance tapes. This was raw-nerved music, too single-minded and intense to carry an obvious timestamp.\u00a0But Massive Attack were the origin point of the trip-hop movement they and their peers were striving to escape the orbit of, and they nearly tore themselves to shreds in the process. Instead\u2014 or maybe as a result\u2014they laid down their going-nova genre's definitive paranoia statement with Mezzanine. The band's third album (not counting the Mad Professor-remixed No Protection) completes the last in a sort of de facto Bristol trilogy, where Tricky\u2019s youthful iconoclasm and Portishead\u2019s deep-focus emotional intensity set the scene for Massive Attack\u2019s sense of near-suffocating dread. The album corroded their tendencies to make big-wheel hymnals of interconnected lives where hope and despair trade precedent\u2014on Mezzanine, it\u2019s alienation all the way down. There\u2019s no safety from harm here, nothing you\u2019ve got to be thankful for, nobody to take the force of the blow: what Mezzanine provides instead is a succession of parties and relationships and panopticons where the walls won\u2019t stop closing in.The lyrics establish this atmosphere all on their own. Sex, in \u201cInertia Creeps,\u201d is reduced to a meeting of \u201ctwo undernourished egos, four rotating hips,\u201d the focus of a failing relationship that's left its participants too numbed with their own routine dishonesty to break it off. The voice singing it\u2014Massive Attack's cornerstone co-writer\/producer Robert \u201c3D\u201d Del Naja\u2014is raspy from exhaustion. \u201cDissolved Girl\u201d reiterates this\u00a0theme from\u00a0the perspective of guest vocalist Sarah Jay Hawley (\u201cPassion\u2019s overrated anyway\u201d). On \u201cRisingson,\u201d Grant \u201cDaddy G\u201d Marshall nails the boredom and anxiety of being stuck somewhere you\u00a0can\u2019t stand with someone you\u2019re\u00a0starting to feel the same way about (\u201cWhy you want to take me to this party and breathe\/I\u2019m dying to leave\/Every time we grind you know we severed lines\u201d). But Mezzanine\u2019s defining moments come from guest vocalists who were famous long before Massive Attack even released their first album. Horace Andy\u00a0was already a legend in reggae circles, but his collaborations with Massive Attack gave him a wider crossover exposure, and all three of his appearances on Mezzanine are homages or nods to songs he'd charted with in his early-\u201970s come-up. \u201cAngel\u201d is a loose rewrite of his 1973 single \u201cYou Are My Angel,\u201d but it\u2019s a fakeout after the first verse\u2014originally a vision of beauty (\u201cCome from way above\/To bring me love\u201d), transformed into an Old Testament avenger: \u201cOn the dark side\/Neutralize every man in sight.\u201d The parenthetically titled, album-closing reprise of \u201c(Exchange)\u201d is a ghostly invocation of Andy\u2019s \u201cSee A Man's Face\u201d cleverly disguised as a comedown track. And then there\u2019s \u201cMan Next Door,\u201d the John Holt standard that Andy had\u00a0previously recorded as \u201cQuiet Place\u201d\u2014on Mezzanine, it sounds less like an overheard argument from the next apartment over and more like a close-quarters reckoning with violence heard through thin walls ready to break. It\u2019s Andy at his emotionally nuanced and evocative best.The other outside vocalist was even more of a coup: Liz Fraser, the singer and songwriter of Cocteau Twins, lends her virtuoso soprano to three songs that feel like exorcisms of\u00a0the personal strife accompanying her band\u2019s\u00a0breakup. Her\u00a0voice serves as an ethereal counterpoint to speaker-rattling production around it. \u201cBlack Milk\u201d contains the album\u2019s most spiritually unnerving words (\u201cEat me\/In the space\/Within my heart\/Love you for God\/Love you for the Mother\u201d), even as her lead\u00a0and the elegiac beat make for some of its most beautiful sounds. She provides\u00a0the wistful counterpoint to the night-shift alienation of \u201cGroup Four.\u201d And then there's \u201cTeardrop,\u201d her finest moment on the album. Legend has it the song was briefly considered for Madonna; Andrew \u201cMushroom\u201d Vowles sent the demo to her, but was overruled by Daddy G and 3D, who both wanted Fraser. Democracy thankfully worked this time around, as Fraser\u2019s performance\u2014recorded in part on the day she discovered that Jeff Buckley, who she\u2019d had an estranged working relationship and friendship with, had drowned in Memphis\u2019 Wolf River\u2014was a heart-rending performance that gave Massive Attack their first (and so far only) UK Top 10 hit.Originally set for a late \u201997 release, Mezzanine got pushed back four months because Del Naja refused to stop reworking the tracks, tearing them apart and rebuilding them until they\u2019re so polished they gleam. It sure sounds like the product of bloody-knuckled labor, all that empty-space reverb and melted-together multitrack vocals and oppressive low-end. (The first sound you hear on the album, that lead-jointed bassline on \u201cAngel,\u201d is to subwoofers what \u201cPlanet Earth\u201d\u00a0is to high-def television.) But it also groans with the burden of creative conflict, a working process that created rifts between Del Naja and Vowles, who left shortly after Mezzanine dropped following nearly 15 years of collaboration.Mezzanine began the band\u2019s relationship with producer Neil Davidge, who\u2019d known Vowles dating back to the early \u201990s and met the rest of the band after the completion of Protection. He picked a chaotic time to jump in, but Davidge and 3D forged a creative bond working through that pressure.\u00a0Mezzanine was a document of unity, not fragmentation. Despite their rifts, they were a\u00a0post-genre outfit, one that couldn\u2019t separate dub from punk from hip-hop from R&B because the basslines all worked together and because classifications are for toe tags. All their\u00a0acknowledged samples\u2014including the joy-buzzer synths from Ultravox\u2019s \u201cRockwrok\u201d (\u201cInertia Creeps\u201d), the opulent ache of Isaac Hayes\u2019 celestial-soul take on \u201cOur Day Will Come\u201d (\u201cExchange\u201d), Robert Smith\u2019s nervous \u201ctick tick tick\u201d from the Cure\u2019s \u201c10:15 Saturday Night,\u201d and the most concrete-crumbling throwdown of the Led Zep \u201cLevee\u201d break ever deployed (the latter two on \u201cMan Next Door\u201d)\u2014were sourced from \u00a01968 and 1978, well-traveled crate-digging territory. But what they build from that is its own beast.\u00a0\u00a0Their\u00a0working method never got any faster. The four-year gap between Protection\u00a0and Mezzanine became a five-year gap until 2003\u2019s 100th Window, then another seven years between that record and 2010\u2019s Heligoland, plus another seven years and counting with no full-lengths to show for it. Not that they've been slacking: we've gotten a multimedia film\/music collaboration with Adam Curtis, the respectable but underrated\u00a0Ritual Spirit EP, and Del Naja\u2019s notoriously rumored side gig as Banksy. (Hey, 3D does have a background in graffiti art.) But the ordeal of both recording and touring Mezzanine took its own toll. A late \u201998 interview with Del Naja saw him optimistic about its reputation-shedding style: \u201cI always said it was for the greater good of the fucking project because if this album was a bit different from the last two, the next one would be even freer to be whatever it wants to be.\u201d But fatigue and restlessness rarely make for a productive mixture, and that same spark of tension which carried Mezzanine over the threshold proved unsustainable, not just for Massive Attack\u2019s creativity but their continued existence.Still, it\u2019s hard not to feel the album\u2019s legacy resonating elsewhere\u2014and not just in \u201cTeardrop\u201d becoming the cue for millions of TV viewers to brace themselves for Hugh Laurie\u2019s cranky-genius-doctor schtick.\u00a0Graft its tense feelings of nervy isolation and late-night melancholy onto two-step, and you\u2019re partway to the blueprint for Plastician and Burial. You can hear flashes of that mournful romantic alienation in James Blake, the graceful, bass-riddled emotional abrasion in FKA twigs, the all-absorbing post-genre rock\/soul ambitions in Young Fathers or Algiers. Mezzanine stands as an album built around echoes of the \u201970s, wrestled through the immediacy of its creators' tumultuous late \u201990s, and fearless enough that it still sounds like it belongs in whatever timeframe you're playing it."}]
