Krallice songs usually sprawl out across nine, eleven minutes; in these cramped confines, Barr and McMaster stage an epic battle for control as the band totters between d-beat and death metal. Without their usual song\u00a0length as a cushion, the song feels like a fight to the death in a windowless room. As the song thrashes itself nearly apart, the doomsday-clock ticking desperation is palpable. In their growing catalog, this is a relatively crisp release, a speedy little roller coaster situated alongside the Towers of Terror. But the moment is dense and terrifying enough to make Krallice fans wonder: What could they accomplish with an album of compositions this compact?"

Uranium Club is a band unafraid to toss a line like \u201cWill you please piss on my teddy bear?\u201d into a song for the pure sake of disorientation.

The band\u2019s lineup was constantly in flux; these songs also feature saxophonist Angie Barrack and vocalists Regula Sing and Chrigle Freund. The reissue\u2019s title is clever; if these 24 tracks are all indeed songs, then Kleenex was reimagining what a song could be. The shortest one, the 69-second \u201c1978,\u201d for example, is a queasy interstitial propelled by unsparing\u00a0riffs and amusingly primordial drumming.\u00a0On \u201cEisiger Wind\u201d (\u201cIcy Wind\u201d), the clangor and \u201cOOO AHHH\u201ds and \u201cLA LA LA LA\u201ds culminate with a nails-tough 15-second coda that brings to mind Mothers of Invention.\u00a0But then, in Kleenex\u2019s gleefully anarchic world, \u201csong structures\u201d seemed tedious."

Before it goes down that route though, a men\u2019s chorus enters, making the \u201cTehillim\u201d (or \u201cpsalms\u201d) of the title a literal reference. The first few times through, the\u00a0combination of choir and drums feels more like a throwback to Enigma.

The disappointments in this moody, make-up babymaker of an EP, then, have more to do with its tone. None of the songs trot along on his signature bright chords, and the closest he comes to going faster is at the very end (but if you\u2019re using the EP as intended, well, perhaps it\u2019s paced perfectly). While lush as ever, the songs never quite catch the \u201cghost\u201d\u2014that ineffable, humbling streak of god in songs that reduce you to tears\u2014like \u201cFancy,\u201d \u201cRockin\u2019 That Shit,\u201d \u201cYamaha,\u201d and others did. Still, he has captured greatness more often than nearly any other modern-day triple threat, and that alone should make you scream his name."

It\u2019s inherent to their deeply poetic lyrics (\u201cWeighing our worth in sacks of black earth/Filling our hearts and our graves with their sum\u201d) and by the whispered passages of William Blake that open and close the album. Blake\u2019s poems also give the record its bookending track titles, \u201cDay\u201d and \u201cNight,\u201d suggesting that\u00a0What Graceless Dawn thematically covers a 24-hour span. This might be true (particularly if the span of your day mostly involves staring awestruck at a blackening sky, contemplating mortality with a lingering sense of dread). But\u00a0Worm Ouroboros\u2019\u00a0power feels mysterious and eternal: In just an hour, they conjure up an entire lifetime of darkness."

In moments like these, Levi\u2019s score emerges unexpectedly, giving a strange stability to these often frayed and vulnerable visual experiences. One moment in particular haunted me. Shortly after the assassination, Portman finds herself in the bathroom of Air Force One, right before LBJ is sworn in as president. She looks in the mirror, wiping away blood from her face and blouse. When Portman cleans the viscera off the mirror, smudging its surface and blurring away her image, the piece\u00a0\u201cTears,\u201d which was barely perceptible as a nervous string arrangement at the beginning of the scene asserts itself. A simple chord progression of keys gives a momentary balm, and frames the scene perfectly. Jackie is replete with visual moments like this one, that are painful to look at. What Levi\u2019s music can do is provide a brief respite, smoothing the razor\u00a0edges of a picture. And unlike her work in Under the Skin, Levi\u2019s score in Jackie is unobtrusive, it exists when you need and want it to, providing either a relief from or a multiplication of the grief the film is relating."

Little on Passion convinces that Cudi is a greater authority on the ways of the world than he\u2019s been before, but growth is not as much a part of his repertoire as the frequent suggestions of ascension would lead you to believe.

In the margins, these themes continuously arise: Talking to Siri when no one will listen, sharing a Netflix account with an ex you never talk to, being attacked by anonymous lynch mobs of trolls and fire-starters in comment sections. It documents life online as a black female gamer, and in turn reveals how the internet is dehumanizing us."

        "review_content": "Non-distinction plagues much of Fireplace. With MellowHype, Hodgy leaned on Left Brain to create the mood. With Left ensuring a consistent vibe, Hodgy was free to express himself with more creative lyrics that rarely explored much, but had great energy. Fireplace lacks any semblance of cohesion in production, which leads to a survey of generic rap beats that ranges from a Clams Casino copycat cut like \u201cResurrection\u201d to the chopped-up soul of the Knxwledge-produced \u201cDreaminofthinkin,\u201d which does not fit Hodgy. There is nothing to ground Hodgy on the record, and very few of the instrumentals catch the ear, despite collaborations with big names, like Unknown Mortal Orchestra, BADBADNOTGOOD, Knx, and 88-Keys."

        "review_content": "\u201cSlight Freedom\u201d sets the tone for the whole album. All four songs, including a drowsy instrumental cover of Frank Ocean\u2019s \u201cSuper Rich Kids\u201d and a loosely woven instrumental version of Billy Strayhorn\u2019s \u201cLush Life,\u201d are quiet, atmospheric mood studies that tend to conceal more than they reveal. Sometimes it seems as if Parker is intent upon hiding behind his own shadow: In \u201cSuper Rich Kids,\u201d his muted, almost bossa nova-like plucks are nearly obscured by sounds pouring in through an open window: braking buses, car horns, the occasional burst of police siren, terse and menacing. A similar kind of veiling happens on \u201cLush Life,\u201d in which a dull electrical hum stretches from beginning to end, masking the contours of Parker\u2019s tremolo-soaked guitar with faint dissonance. Parker\u2019s take on the standard is bittersweet, almost resigned; from time to time, the melody reluctantly pokes its head out from beneath the chords, but mostly the song dwells in an all-consuming fog\u2014a perfect evocation of Strayhorn\u2019s hungover and heartbroken narrator, slumped against the bar in some seedy dive."

A-Trak filters the kick down to a muffled throb redolent of \u201cAround the World,\u201d before bringing in a swell of disco symphonic strings and electro squelch, ranging from Ed Banger filter house to Daft Punk then back to Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois disco. Similar sensibilities get applied to Phoenix\u2019s \u201cTrying to Be Cool\u201d as he builds the opening keyboard figure into something bombastic. Visit a section of the song that doesn't have Thomas Mars\u2019 telltale voice and one would be hard-pressed to distinguish it from any other track of the past decade."

Its ghostly instrumentation and measured pace distort your sense of time in a manner similar to stark classics like Songs: Ohia\u2019s Didn\u2019t It Rain. Williamson has evolved subtly over her two records, and Heart Song lifts her finally and definitely out of the world of \u201cfolk\u201d into something deeper, more uncanny, and out-of-time. Heart Song never tires nor loses its tension, as if Williamson\u2019s voice has finally found its proper milieu."

The nu-disco number \u201cCat Thruster\u201d manages the perfect balance of slouching cool and giddy kitsch, playing legato synth riffs and ersatz electric bass off harp flourishes and clever chord changes; if someone told you it was a new Todd Terje tune, you probably wouldn\u2019t bat an eye.

But there\u2019s nothing haphazard about the finished product. In \u201cHead Within a Head,\u201d the use of deep, floor-rattling blips works well alongside the instrument\u2019s eccentricities. And the tone clusters that drive \u201cMt. Erased\u201d have a chattering, jittery air.

Turning 25 on May 24th in Paris (discs 26 and 27), Dylan goes into near meltdown, attempting desperately to get his acoustic instrument in tune. \u201cThis never happens to my electric guitar,\u201d he deadpans, a punchline deployed many nights, part prop theater (\u201cThis machine confuses fascists\u201d), part a musician's nightmare of gear damaged in transit. Slurring his words, Dylan is deeply inside of both himself and his songs, his Woody Guthrie drawl blurred into the oft-caricatured nasal howl. One takeaway, though, and perhaps the perpetual Dylan hot take, is that the dude actually is an amazing singer, lingering sensuously on every syllable during the quiet acoustic sets and occupying every bit of smarter-than-thou word-play and put-downs when the electric guitars come out."

Villalobos remains commendably weird in almost every way, even if, as a project, Ricmho seems only half-formed.
